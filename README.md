# odin-recipes
This output of this project will be a recipe website. This will demonstrate the HTML skills I have gained so far to include creating the proper structure through headings and paragraphs as well as the inclusion of links and photographs. Both unordered and ordered lists will also be used as part of the website.

Other skills that will be demonstrated will be the use of git and github.
